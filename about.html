					    <h4>
			   				The goal of antmaps.org is to provide an intuitive and efficient framework for professional and amateur myrmecologists to visualize
			   				the known distribution of ant species or higher taxon, and to access the underlying records for those data.    
					    </h4>
					    
					    <h4>
					        antmaps.org is not a database <span class="italic">per se</span>, but rather a client-end tool for visualizing and interacting with the GABI database. 
					        The <a href="https://benoitguenard.wordpress.com/gabi-articles/">Global Ant Biodiversity Informatics</a> (GABI) project 
					        (<a href="https://myrmecologicalnews.org/cms/index.php?option=com_download&view=download&filename=volume24/mn24_83-89_printable.pdf&format=raw">Guénard
					        et al. 2017 <span class="italic">Myrmecological News</span></a>) is an attempt to consolidate and curate a comprehensive global database of ant species
					        distributional records, including literature records, museum databases, and online specimen databases. As of July 2018, the database includes records
					        from over 9300 publications, most major digitized museum collections, and specimen databases such as AntWeb. In total, the database now has over 1.9
					        million records including around 15000 described ant species and subspecies. The GABI data are currently housed in a
					        <a href=" https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> database that synchronizes once per week with antmaps.org. 
					    </h4>
					    <h4>
					    	Antmaps.org is intended to complement other invaluable web tools for myrmecology such as <a href="https://antweb.org/">AntWeb</a> and 
					    	<a href="http://www.antwiki.org">AntWiki</a>.  While those are more comprehensive and multifaceted resources on ant biodiversity, antmaps.org is specifically
					    	built for a single purpose; mapping species distributions and aggregate diversity patterns and visualizing data from GABI. 
					    </h4>
					    
					     
					    <h4>
					    	In many ways GABI is raw material for myrmecologists, a point of departure for characterizing and understanding the geographic distribution of a species
					    	or group, and not a final answer. There are errors and uncertainties that are inherited from the data sources, and others that might have been introduced
					    	during the databasing process. Distributional data in GABI should be viewed critically before forming the basis of scientific investigation. New records
					    	are continuously compiled and taxonomic changes updated within GABI to provide the latest developments on ant biogeography and taxonomy (with a few weeks
					    	needed for records to be processed). We welcome the participation of the myrmecological community in these efforts. If you see something questionable,
					    	click "Report data issue" and let us know about the specific issue, or <a href="mailto:zeroben@gmail.com,evaneconomo@gmail.com" target="_top">contact us</a>
					    	to let us know about information we might have missed. One of the main goals of antmaps.org is to facilitate and accelerate this process.

					    <h4>    
					        Literature records have been compiled by three groups:
					        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
					            <li>Benoit Guénard and Economo lab members (approximately 600,000 records, from 7660 publications).</li>
					            <li>Mike Weiser, working with Rob Dunn and Nate Sanders (approx. 90,000 records, from 925 publications).</li>
					            <li>Kiko Gomez (approx. 30,000 records from 717 publications)</li>
					        </ul>
					    </h4>
					    
					    <h3>Beyond Data Compilation</h3>
					    <h4>
					        Besides the process of data compilation and associating each species record with a valid taxonomic name and a particular geographic region to be correctly
					        displayed on antmaps.org, we also work on other aspects of the information briefly introduced below.
					    </h4>
					    <h4>
					        While far from perfect, antmaps.org also attempts to provide accurate information about species distribution and identity. Important efforts are thus
					        directed to identify potential misidentifications that have accumulated over centuries of myrmecology. Patiently and one by one, nearly 25,000 records have
					        been identified as potentially erroneous and many more probably remains. Slowly, as we detect these mistakes those are flagged within GABI and displayed on
					        antmaps.org to prevent other researchers to repeat them and to adopt a cautious attitude towards them.  If you are aware of such errors, don’t hesitate to
					        contact us to let us know about them so the ant community could benefit from this knowledge.
					    </h4>
					    <h4>
					        Taxonomy is a living field of biology. Species identity and definition are not fixed and from time to time might change in function of new research being
					        developed. We attempt to track these changes by following taxonomic literature and use Antcat.org as an ultimate reference. Monthly, taxonomic updates including
					        new taxonomic descriptions, synonymy, splitting or any other changes are implemented within GABI to provide the latest development on species taxonomy and
					        distribution.
					    </h4>
					    <h4>
					        Biological invasions are increasingly widespread and ants are no exception. Native and exotic distribution are being tracked in GABI/antmaps.org to display
					        known distribution of these species established outside their native range. However, establishing the extent of native versus exotic range represents in many
					        instance a real challenge, with knowledge for many species relying on fragmentary information or guess more than proven results. Here we attempt to display those
					        to the best of our knowledge and are looking for new studies determining exact ranges. You might disagree with our classification and we’ll be happy to discuss
					        how our decisions were taken or on which sources they are relying. Here again, do not hesitate to contact us to let us know new records or simply inquiry about
					        the status of a given species.
					    </h4>
					    <h4>
					        Finally, note that continuous updates are being performed in GABI and thus antmaps.org, and we encourage you to note the date at which you retrieve a
					        particular information as it is subject to potential changes in the future. 
					    </h4>
					    
					    <h3> Data Accessibility </h3>
					    <h4>
					        For the very near future, the full GABI data and citation information are not freely accessible for download, because we are still implementing data cleaning
					        and processing steps, in addition to a large-scale georeferencing effort that is not done. We’d like to avoid large blocks of the data circulating until we can
					        be sure of its quality and completeness. We apologize for the inconvenience. In the meantime, if you need to get access to specific records or have an idea for
					        an analysis using the data, we encourage users to <a href="mailto:zeroben@gmail.com,evaneconomo@gmail.com" target="_top">contact us</a> directly and have never
					        denied anyone access. We don’t advise using raw data taken from antmaps.org for research/publication without discussing the data with us first.

					        Finally, when browsing antmaps.org, you can see the underlying citations that are behind the data. It can be hard to cite hundreds or thousands of papers at

					        megacephala</i> in Okinawa, or maybe a recent checklist contributed most of the records for a particular region, please try to cite those original sources,
					        as well! antmaps.org is intended to help you find those sources, not replace them.
					        We also appreciate it if you credit antmaps.org if you use the maps or data in a talk.
